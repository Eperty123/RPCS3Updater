# What is this?
RPCS3Updater is a neat little launcher that automatically checks for new builds of RPCS3 and updates your current. (If desired.)

# Pre-requisits
RPCS3Updater requires .NET 4.7.2 installed on your computer to work.
Grab that here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472

# Notes
RPCS3Updater requires internet access on launch to be able to check for updates.
It also requires the file "RPCS3.log" that resides inside the same directory. (In your RPCS3 folder.)

If not existent the launcher will keep updating your build even if it's the latest! This is the current way of keeping track of builds.
I may change this in the future.
