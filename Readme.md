# What is this?
RPCS3Updater is a neat little launcher that automatically checks for new builds of RPCS3 and updates your current. (If desired.) It uses Github's API to fetch the builds catalogue.

# Pre-requisits
* RPCS3Updater requires .NET 4.7.2 installed on your computer to work.
Grab that here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472
* Internet connection

# Build tracking
RPCS3Updater requires internet access on launch to be able to check for updates.
It also requires the file "RPCS3.log" that resides inside the same directory. (In your RPCS3 folder.)

If non existent the launcher will keep updating your build even if it's the latest! So make sure you start RPCS3 with either RPCS3Updater. This is the current way of keeping track of builds. I may change this in the future.
